Hi Priscilla,

Thank you for reaching out and for the opportunity to move forward in the process.

I'd be happy to schedule a 30-minute interview with your Business Lead via Teams. Below is my availability (in KST) over the next couple of weeks:

**Week 1:**
- Monday, [Date]: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM or 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM
- Wednesday, [Date]: 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM or 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM
- Friday, [Date]: 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM or 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM

**Week 2:**
- Monday, [Date]: 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM or 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM
- Wednesday, [Date]: 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM or 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM
- Thursday, [Date]: 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM or 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM

Please let me know which time slot works best for the team, and I'm happy to adjust if needed.

Thank you for sharing those resources. I'll review them to better understand Palantir's work, products, and impact before the initial conversation.

I do have a couple of other opportunities in their 2nd and 3rd stages, but Palantir is my priority right now. I'll be sure to keep you updated on any timeline considerations as they arise.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,
Daniel
